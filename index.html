            If you like dogs and starchy snacks, then science guarantees that you are going to love 
            our organization. We host monthly meetings where members are given an opportunity to connect with rescued canines while enjoying a delicious
            piece of polish quisine. Our hope is to find a lovely home for as many of these wayward animals as possible. However, interest in adoption
            is not a requirement for attendance. Your time and affection alone are priceless for these pups.
